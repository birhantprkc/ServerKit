"""Built-in periodic job handlers + their schedules.

These are the platform's own recurring tasks. They used to each run in a
dedicated daemon thread spawned from ``app/__init__.py`` (auto-sync,
snapshot-retention, workflow scheduler, health-check poller, WP safe-update,
hourly API background, pairing pruner, registrar expiry). They now run as
``ScheduledJob`` rows enqueued by the single ``JobScheduler`` and executed by the
single ``JobConsumer``.

The check/run functions below are relocated verbatim from ``app/__init__.py`` so
behavior — cadence handling, per-task de-dup, idempotency — is unchanged; only
the trigger moved from a bare thread to the unified job system.
